# HTML5 Asteroids

This game was created Doug McInnes. His code can be found
[here](https://github.com/dmcinnes/HTML5-Asteroids), and you can play his
version of the game online at his website
[here](http://dougmcinnes.com/2010/05/12/html-5-asteroids/).

Caroline Buckey and Sarah Spikes modified the repository to create exercises for
the Udacity course [Version Control Using Git and Github](TODO). These
modifications included introducing bugs and other changes into Dougâ€™s commits he
did not in fact create! The bugs are intended to give learners experience using
Git to find the commit where a bug was introduced. To play the modified version
of the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Many thanks to Doug for creating this awesome game.
