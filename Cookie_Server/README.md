# Project - Cookie Server

Setting an [HTTP cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) is an important function of websites and web applications.


## Project Overview

In this project, we'll create and read an [HTTP cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to remember the name of a user submitted in a form.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need to install:

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)

### Files

* `cookie_server.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that sets a cookie when a user enters a name.
* `test.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that tests if a cookie was set.


## Running the Application

You can run the python application with the following command:

`python cookie_server.py`

Then test if the cookie was set by opening another terminal window and running:

`python test.py`
