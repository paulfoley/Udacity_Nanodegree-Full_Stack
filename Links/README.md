# Project - Links

Performing [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) functions on database is an important part of building web applications.


## Project Overview

In this project, we will perform a wide arrange of queries using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) on a database.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need to install:

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

### Files

* `links.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that performs queries on the links database.
* `database_setup.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that createss the links database.


## Running the Application

To get started the links database needs to be created by running:

`python database_setup.py`

After this script runs you should see `link.db` created in the folder. Next run the queries with:

`python queries.py`
