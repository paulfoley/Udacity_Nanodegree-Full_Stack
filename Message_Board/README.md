# Project - Message Board

One of the most common methods of web applications is GET and POST.


## Project Overview

In this project, we'll create a message board that can both GET and POST.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need to install:

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)

### Files

* `message_board.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that creates a message board.
* `test.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that tests if the message board can GET and POST.


## Running the Application

You can run the python application with the following command:

`python message_board.py`

Then test if the message board will GET and POST data by opening another terminal window and running:

`python test.py`
