# Project - Employees

Businesses use web applications all the time to optimize their operations. A key part of these business applications is creating a database that stores a user and their information.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a simple application that holds information on employees.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need to install:

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/)
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

### Files

* `employees.py` - [Python](https://www.python.org/) script that uses [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to create, update, and read new employees in the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
* `database_setup.py` - [[Python](https://www.python.org/) script that uses [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to create a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database with the Employee and Adress tables.


## Running the Application

First we'll need to setup the [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database, to do that run the following command:

`python bug_management.py`

Next we will add users to the database, by running:

`python employees.py`
