In this project, you’ll be taking apart the Project Compass web app. You will examine the features of Project Compass and identify who (**front end, back end, mobile, or data analyst**) would contribute towards each component of the web app. You will provide explanations for your answers to show your understanding of these four roles within programming.

## What is Reverse Engineering?
Engineering is the science of  inventing, designing, and building. Reverse engineering is the process of taking apart what has already been built to better understand how the things work. We will reverse engineer Project Compass by isolating each feature to evaluate what type of programmer was involved in creating it.
